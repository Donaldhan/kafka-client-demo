/**
 * ConsumerRebalanceListener see#
 * http://kafka.apache.org/090/javadoc/index.html?org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/KafkaConsumer.html
 * ConsumerRebalanceListener A callback interface that the user can implement to trigger custom actions 
 * when the set of partitions assigned to the consumer changes.
 * 
 * This is applicable when the consumer is having Kafka auto-manage group membership. 
 * If the consumer's directly assign partitions, those partitions will never be reassigned and this callback is not applicable.
 * 
 * When Kafka is managing the group membership, a partition re-assignment will be triggered 
 * any time the members of the group changes or the subscription of the members changes. 
 * This can occur when processes die, new process instances are added or old instances come 
 * back to life after failure. Rebalances can also be triggered by changes affecting the subscribed 
 * topics (e.g. when then number of partitions is administratively adjusted).
 * 
 * There are many uses for this functionality. One common use is saving offsets in a custom store. 
 * By saving offsets in the onPartitionsRevoked(Collection), call we can ensure that any time partition 
 * assignment changes the offset gets saved.
 * 
 * Another use is flushing out any kind of cache of intermediate results the consumer may be keeping. 
 * For example, consider a case where the consumer is subscribed to a topic containing user page views, 
 * and the goal is to count the number of page views per users for each five minute window. Let's say 
 * the topic is partitioned by the user id so that all events for a particular user will go to a single 
 * consumer instance. The consumer can keep in memory a running tally of actions per user and only flush 
 * these out to a remote data store when its cache gets to big. However if a partition is reassigned it 
 * may want to automatically trigger a flush of this cache, before the new owner takes over consumption.
 * 
 * This callback will execute in the user thread as part of the poll(long) call whenever partition assignment changes.
 * 
 * It is guaranteed that all consumer processes will invoke onPartitionsRevoked prior to any process
 * invoking onPartitionsAssigned. So if offsets or other state is saved in the onPartitionsRevoked call 
 * it is guaranteed to be saved by the time the process taking over that partition has their onPartitionsAssigned 
 * callback called to load the state. 
 * 
 * Re-balancer for any subscription changes.
